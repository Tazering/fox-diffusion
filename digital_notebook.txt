Digital Notebook

09/01/2024
Introduction to Project Topic
	- read through docx file
	- learned about diffusion models via powerpoint


Meeting 09/10/2024
Two papers in the document
	- [1] from Berkeley
	- [7][8] from Irvine
Run the github code on Rivanna system
	- data comes from papers

First step is to reproduce results from Irvine paper
	- focus on diffusion mechanics

Berkeley paper references code from Irvine paper

Data Assimilation

New and Promising way to do digital twins

Meeting 09/13/2024

Professor Fox provided us with another paper to look at regarding diffusion models

Zeyu read the papers
	- not necessarily open source
	- Irvine team not responsive regarding correct model or not

My job: read the papers and let Zeyu know about it
	- format it in a paper approach maybe
	- maybe also try powerpoint

Meeting 09/20/2024

One group does not know what model they used.
Neurips paper has paper while others do not. 
Seems like Berkeley paper references Irvine paper.

Generative AI can denoise the data

Won't use true values for training the model in hopes of getting them back to the original model

Will try to describe the data

My task:
	- read through papers and provide presentations by next or following week
	- provide presentation/reference guide on diffusion models
	- focus on understanding diffusion

Meeting 10/11/2024
We presented on the two papers. Recommends looking at OmniFold.

Tasks:
	- Paper Review for OmniFold
	- Better understand Diffusion Models


Next Task:
	- Paper Review [8]
	- Diffusion Models 

Meeting 11/17/2024

Task:
	- comment/document end-to-end diffusion model and get Irvine code working
		- take data from Berkeley paper
	- pythia8 usage
	- what exactly is unfolding

Meeting 11/24/2024

Task:
	- Get updated Irvine paper working
	- Write detailed comments on Irvine 2.0

Meeting 12/13/2024

Task:
	- Get code to run
	- Document the code

Meeting 12/20/2024	

- no need to use multiplicity predictor

Task:
	- Understand the Code

Meeting 01/03/2025

	- Jefferson Lab looking for unstable particles
	- new meson resonances
	- take data from 2 fast pions to photon / rho

Task:
	- Find what B, T, and D mean for jet embeddings
	- understand code structure of diffusion model and understand the structure of the code

Subtasks:
	- Create sample npz file for testing
	- Figure out how to use checkpoints

Meeting 01/10/2025

Task:
	- Create sample npz file for testing
	- Figure out how to use checkpoints
	- Paper Review

Meeting 02/28/2024

Task:
	- detector level: 5 MEV noise pollution (error < 5MEV)
	- particle level: actual data
	- initial = final
